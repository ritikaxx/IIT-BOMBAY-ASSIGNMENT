# IIT-BOMBAY-ASSIGNMENT
QT DEVELOPMENT TASK FOR IIT BOMBAY INTERNSHIP.


# HOW TO RUN THE CODE-

1.Clone the repository.
2.Install QT Creator.
3.Open the project.
4.Build and run the code.(The UI will open and you can experiment with the various features).

# FEATURES IMPLEMENTED IN THE NOTEPAD UI

1.Opening a file.
2.Saving a file.
3.Save as option for an edited file.

4. Bold/ Unbold/ Italic a particular text.
5.Superscript/ Subscript selected text. - Checkable

6.Dark mode(EXTRA FEATURE ADDED) - Checkable 
7. ABOUT ME BUTTON as well as from Menu- opens my resume in a dialog box.

# ISSUES AND DIFFICULTIES.

1. No feature already present in the libraries with QT for superscript and subscript , so had to look on that.
2. Couldnt create the superscript and subscript action from the UI directly (maybe because it was a checkable feature) , so had to code it to set the actions.
